# Kitchen scene assets

Included out of the box (SVG):

- **kitchen-base.svg** – Base 2D kitchen layout (backsplash, cabinets, counter, floor).
- **mask-countertop.svg**, **mask-backsplash.svg**, **mask-cabinet.svg**, **mask-floor.svg** – White-on-transparent region masks for compositing.

To use your own photo and masks, add JPG/PNG files and point scene URLs in the CMS to them (e.g. `scenes/kitchen-base.jpg`). Masks: white = apply texture, transparent = ignore.
